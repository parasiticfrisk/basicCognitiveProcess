            <summary>How does extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) compare to regular olive oil?</summary>
            <p>EVOO is made from pure, cold-pressed olives and is certified as free of any defects in flavor or odor,
                when tested by a trained panel of experts. Regular olive oil is made from a blend of cold-pressed and
                processed oils.</p>

            <summary>Does olive oil get better over time?</summary>
            <p>Unlike wine, olive does not improve with age. For optimum health benefits and flavor, purchase EVOO
                within 12 to 18 months of harvest, and use within six months of opening.</p>
