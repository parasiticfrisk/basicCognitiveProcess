## Course Description:
Generators are a concept unique to Python. They're incredibly helpful if you know how and when to use them. Simply put, generators are the best way to iterate through large and complex data sets. Pythonista Josh McQuiston explains everything you need to know about Python generators, providing examples of generators in action. Learn how to build a basic generator function, use generator expressions and objects, and see how generators work behind the scenes to power context managers and coroutines.
