## Course Description:
Parallel programming unlocks a programâ€™s ability to execute multiple instructions simultaneously, increases the overall processing throughput, and is key to writing faster and more efficient applications. Curious about how parallel programming works in the real world? In this course, join instructors Barron and Olivia Stone as they introduce the basics of parallel programming in Python, providing the foundational knowledge you need to write more efficient, performant code. Barron and Olivia explain concepts like threading and mutual exclusion in a fun and informative way, relating them to everyday activities you perform in the kitchen. To cement the ideas, they demo them in action using Python. Each lesson is short and practical, driving home the theory with hands-on techniques.
